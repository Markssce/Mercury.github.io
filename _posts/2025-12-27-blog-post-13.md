-  I’ve made up my mind to resign at the end of 2025, and in the blink of an eye, my three-month internship is drawing to a close. My heart is calm, without the ups and downs I had imagined. I’m so eager to take a break, for there are still so many things I need to do—I have no other choice.

<br/>

-  As the year draws to a close, a voice deep inside always urges me loudly: it’s time to reflect! To sum up the gains and losses, as well as the sceneries along the way this year! I specially set aside this Saturday evening, washed my hands clean, and sat down quietly to write these words.

<br/>

-  Recently, I’ve been having strange dreams. In those dreams, I spoke a lot, did a lot of things, and met many people. Once, I had a nightmare, though I can’t recall the details clearly. I tried to wake myself up but found I couldn’t—like a bird trapped in a cage. In the end, I still managed to jolt awake, sat up straight, and sighed with my face in my hands.

<br/>

-  Time really flies. Not long ago, in a video by Director Bi, he mentioned that our sensory systems actually follow a logarithmic rule: for example, the loudness of sounds, the brightness of lights…

<br/>

-  If our perception of time length is based not on absolute duration, but on the proportion of time relative to the life we have already lived, then according to the logarithmic model, if we start counting from the age of 4, when we begin to form clear memories, each passing year will carry less and less psychological weight as we grow older. That’s exactly why I feel that “time seems to pass faster and faster as I get older”. Under this hypothetical “proportional perception” model, the midpoint of life is roughly around the age of 18.

<br/>

-  Back in February this year, I made a firm resolution to keep fit and lose weight properly. When the new semester started in March, I signed up for a gym membership. I’m truly grateful to Wang and Huang for taking me to try out the gym and training with me. Without you two, I might have hesitated again and again and never mustered up the courage to go to the gym at all. In the first half of the year, I worked out on and off without a proper plan. Coupled with the heavy workload from school courses and postgraduate recommendation procedures, I was stretched too thin to make any real progress. Things took a turn for the better in September: first, I landed an internship at a suitable company; second, the school affairs finally settled down temporarily, allowing me to have more time to focus on self-improvement. In August, I gritted my teeth and bought a bicycle. When I first got it, I rode it every single day until my iliopsoas muscles ached so badly that I couldn’t even touch them, let alone move normally.

<br/>

-  I did the math—so far, I’ve ridden a total of exactly 1,300 kilometers. At the end of September, I purchased a personal training membership. Over the past three months, I’ve been to the gym more than sixty times, and successfully gained weight from the initial 73 kg to 78 kg. Fitness has helped me tremendously. When I’m working out, my brain doesn’t wander aimlessly; I just need to engage the designated muscle groups and perform mechanical repetitive movements with all my strength. During those moments, the only thing I have to think about is fitness—everything else fades away. I really love this feeling, especially after a workout, when my muscles are sore and aching, and as I ride my bike back to the dormitory, my mind feels clear and refreshed, with a gentle and pleasant breeze brushing against me.

<br/>

-  By July, everything had settled down. I thought the regret and frustration would drift away along with the sea breeze of La Spezia, but the endless melancholy kept crashing over the shores of my heart like the Mediterranean waves. I often found myself staring blankly out the window, wondering what I would be like in another parallel world. After a moment of daze, I would snap back to reality and tell myself: there’s no time to wallow in self-pity or get lost in reverie. It’s easy to paint a blueprint for the future, but there lies an insurmountable gap between reality and aspiration. Once, when I was having dinner and chatting with a classmate, I said that looking back, childhood was truly blissful, a time of carefree innocence. My classmate put down his chopsticks and said earnestly: perhaps childhood was also filled with hardships, and we went through many difficulties and challenges back then—it’s just that compared to the pains we face now, those seem trivial in hindsight. It does make sense somehow, but one thing I’m certain of is that I’ll never again experience that instant sense of relief and joy I felt when the Friday afternoon dismissal bell rang during my primary and middle school days. And perhaps, I never will again.

<br/>

-  “Past mistakes, once realized, are beyond redemption; yet the future remains ours to strive for.” In truth, there is no such concept as “tomorrow”—the only certainty we have is that every “yesterday” is gone forever, and every “tomorrow” is merely a continuation of “today”. Sometimes, I constantly complain about being too stupid, too busy, and too tired. But would I truly be happy if I were not stupid, not busy, and not tired? Does such simple happiness even exist? I don’t know. Since I can’t change these objective factors, the only thing I really need to think about is to live each day earnestly.

<br/>

-  This year has been extraordinarily meaningful to me. Some people say that the period before the age of 20 is the foundational stage for building one’s cognitive framework: abstract logical thinking and dialectical thinking gradually mature, the rudiments of relatively stable values and a worldview begin to take shape. During this phase, through school education, family influence, and initial social experiences, we construct the basic framework for perceiving the world—such as the fundamental judgments of right and wrong, good and evil, and social rules.

<br/>

-  Not long ago, I read a sentence: “You cannot be someone you have never seen before.” I think the word “be” here is a translation from English, and the rendering of “be” as “成为 (to become)” in  Chinese is not entirely accurate. My understanding is that from the people we have encountered, we gain the insight that “so this problem can also be approached in this way”, thus equipping ourselves with an extra perspective when facing similar issues next time. When I was a sophomore taking the Academic English Writing course, Professor Qian, who taught us, said that the English word “be” carries such rich connotations—it’s truly fascinating. Thank you to every person I have met; it is because of you that I am who I am today.

<br/>

-  As the new year begins, I want to say to myself: you will never be younger and more vibrant than you are today. So, please seize the present moment, and please do not be too harsh on the confused and helpless version of yourself.
