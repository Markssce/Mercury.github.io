- finish the last free lunch in QXSI, and tommorrow I'm gonna leave here perhaps forever.
- What a pleasent journey that I have! THX every guy here giving me support and help. Hope you guys all in well next year.
- I have a lot to say but I do think take the chance to feel and enjoy the rest of my intern is of great importance.
- These days I finish reading the 《Lectures on Modern Western History》. This is one of the greatest books that I have read!
- I do believe that reading books is like finding the sentences that you wanna say. I have a lot of problems to be solved and find some answers in this book.
- Keep listening. Do hope the great things will come. Never mind. The punishment of learning more things is feeling the powerlessness. Luckily, I can feel and take the pain=)
