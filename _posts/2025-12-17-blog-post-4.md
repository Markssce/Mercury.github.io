# “An overview of ground-penetrating radar signal processing techniques for road inspections”

## Problem:

- “Safety concerns and economical savings in road construction and maintenance strategies are no doubt the two main issues around which considerable efforts of engineers and practitioners are being increasingly focused.” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 201)

- “cracks, potholes, and surface deformations can generate sudden vertical accelerations on the vehicle tires, thereby lowering the effective friction between tires and pavement surface and raising the probability of car accidents” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 201) Core Problem

- “one of the most effective and powerful, due to its high flexibility of usage and reliability of results. Basically, this tool enables to infer information on the physical and geometrical conditions of the subsurface relying on the transmission and reception of short electromagnetic (EM) impulses in a given frequency band” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 201)

## Method:

- “focuses on the processing methodologies for the interpretation of the data collected in road inspections, which also constitute part of the acknowledged GPR techniques within other disciplines and applications.” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 208)

## Difference:

- “The more complex is the processing, the higher is the risk of introducing artefacts in the data, which can lead to wrong interpretations.” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 208)

- “processing has a cost, which mainly consists in the use of human resources.” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 208)

- “Even more in case of road inspections, characterized by a huge amount of data, it is mandatory to invest time and efforts in analyzing the data collected before the processing, focusing on the main requirements and expected deliverables, and to set the most effective strategy for reaching the goal of the survey.” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 208)

## University:
- “how each processing technique is suitable for a specific purpose. It is then crucial to set the objectives prior to process the data, in order to choose the relevant processing schemes, such that it would be more likely to avoid distortion and over-processing of the data and, mostly, waste of time.” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 208)

- “quality of the dataset influences the intensity of the processing needed for increasing the data readability.” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 208)
 
- “proper performance of a GPR survey on the site is the fundamental and most important factor to pursue, in order to emphasize the effectiveness of the data processing.” (Benedetto et al., 2017, p. 208)
