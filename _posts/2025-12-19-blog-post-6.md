- Have a cup of Negorni yesterday, so wonderful dream that I have!
- Unstall the doyin app:-( In fact I'm reluctant to do that but I have to. I don't wanna meaningless things and people waste my time. 😭
- Plan to have a ride tomorrow. Hope that the weather will be sunny and warm as same as today! So that I can wear my riding fit this Sat.
- Next week is going to be a tough weeek... I really wanna have a break. But coach said that comfort is left for the dead. Maybe I'm just a little bit nervous. After quitting the job, I gotta have a travel and relax for a while.
